# company-os

A company brain in markdown and SQLite. Your files stay the source of truth. company-os indexes them, checks them against reality and answers questions in milliseconds, for you and for the agent you already use. Zero dependencies (Node 22, `node:sqlite`). MIT.

```
company-os init            # a config in your folder
company-os index           # markdown → index
company-os account harper  # one account: status, ball, pipeline row, last contact
company-os canon pricing   # the one file prices live in
company-os ticket 6a9413   # one card as a brief: description, checklists, attachments on disk
company-os boards          # the boards this brain expects; --create makes what is missing
company-os check           # drift: stale pages, dead links, pipeline vs. folders, copied figures
company-os serve           # the same answers as MCP tools, for Claude Code or Cursor
```

There is no package to install: clone the repo and link the command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mondayrunner/company-os.git
cd company-os && npm link      # or: alias company-os="node $PWD/bin/company-os.mjs"
```

Want a brain to start from? Clone [company-brain](https://github.com/mondayrunner/company-brain), an empty company brain in plain markdown, and run `company-os init` inside it: init recognises the layout, writes a matching config and leaves your files alone.

New here? Read [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md), ten minutes from clone to a brain that answers. Letting your agent install it? Point it at [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): the setup as a conversation, with the questions it asks you and the rules it keeps. Prefer pictures?

Your company has a memory that lives in folders. Every morning notes come in: messages, recordings, what happened in the bank. A robot sorts them into the right folder. When you ask something, it looks through the folders and tells you where it found the answer. Every week it checks whether notes have gone stale and asks you: shall I fix this? It never fixes anything on its own. Anything that leaves the building, an email or an invoice, you send by hand.

## Try the example first

`examples/acme` is a small fictional studio: three accounts, a partner, a pipeline, a price list, a compass, a task list and one recording waiting for you to file.

```bash
cd examples/acme
company-os index
company-os account harper
company-os accounts
company-os canon pricing
company-os check --no-live     # finds the drift the example plants
```

Delete `.company-os/` and run `index` again. Nothing is lost, because the markdown is the source and the database is a cache. `test/example.test.mjs` keeps every command above working.

## Four parts

Every company brain has the same four parts (after *The Ontology of the Company Brain*, Slite 2026). What company-os does for each:

1. **Getting signals.** Connectors pull from your tools on a schedule. Every job writes a status file, so a job that stops is a finding and not a silence.
2. **Remembering.** Markdown in git is the canon. `brain.db` is an index you can delete; `company-os index` rebuilds it. Daily numbers also go to `metrics.csv`, because you cannot recompute yesterday's MRR.
3. **Dreaming and pruning.** `company-os check` runs deterministic checks and posts findings to an inbox. You decide. The brain proposes, it never changes canon on its own.
4. **Speaking and searching.** An MCP server with tools that answer from the files: `account`, `accounts`, `canon`, `search`, the live sources, and three reversible writes. No tool calls a model. The agent you talk to does the thinking, so an answer takes milliseconds.

One rule follows from this: **figures that live in a system of record (MRR in Stripe, cards in Trello) are never copied into markdown.** The brain reads them live and snapshots a few numbers a day. A copy starts ageing the moment you make it, and `check` flags copies.

## Sources are connectors, and yours will differ

company-os does not know where your work, your conversations or your money live. Every outside source is a connector: one file with one contract (below). The base needs none of them. A folder of markdown, a `tasks.md` and the `status` connector are enough to index, search, check and answer over MCP, and that is where everyone starts.

Nine connectors ship because we use them: **Trello** for work, **Paraspeech** for recordings, **Stripe** for money, plus `imap`, `ics-calendar`, `metrics-http`, `markdown`, `status` and `tasks-markdown`. Treat them as worked examples. If your work lives in Linear, your recordings in Fireflies and your money in Mollie, you write three files against the same contract and the rest of the brain (checks, inbox, MCP, dashboard) does not change. What the shipped ones do, so you know what to copy:

- `trello`: `company-os boards` reads the boards from your config, says which are missing and creates them with `--create`; `company-os ticket <card>` turns one card into a brief an agent can start on, with description, checklists, comments and the attachments downloaded to disk (a Trello attachment URL is private, so a link nobody can open is not a brief). A card with only a title is still a brief (the agent reads the title as the job, looks around first, and asks when it is ambiguous); only a card without a title comes back `empty`.
- `paraspeech`: files recordings of ten minutes or more into the transcript inbox with a proposal for who they were with. `company-os link` attaches the ones it is sure about; the `unfiled-transcripts` check names the ones still waiting, otherwise that folder is the one place where doing nothing looks exactly like being up to date.
- `stripe`: answers the money questions live, and `subscriptions-vs-accounts` says when a subscription and a folder disagree.

The live sources are never copied, which leaves one gap: the source moved and the folder did not. Four checks close it, all the same shape (something happened, the folder's newest file is older, so it is not written down yet): `mail-vs-accounts`, `transcripts-vs-accounts`, `calendar-vs-accounts` and `board-vs-pipeline`. Each runs only when its connector is configured. Process the event into the folder and the finding closes itself.

A finding is not a ticket for the human to work off. Where the check can carry the work itself it does: `board-vs-pipeline` with `sync: true` makes the missing cards and reports it; `mail-vs-accounts` and `transcripts-vs-accounts` post a *proposal* that carries the mails or the transcript, so approving it is enough and an agent writes the call into the status file; `calendar-vs-accounts` asks one sentence ("what came out of it?") and files the reply as a dated log line. What is left for the human is the judgement call, alive or lost, lead or casual contact, asked once for the group, not once per item. Every run that did something posts one summary so the inbox reads as news, not as a ticket queue.

## Configuration

Everything is `company-os.config.json` at the root of your folder. Folder names are yours; the config says which folder plays which role.

```json
{
  "name": "Acme", "language": "en",
  "kinds": [{ "kind": "knowledge", "prefix": "knowledge/" }, { "kind": "account", "pattern": "^accounts/[^/]+/" }],
  "accounts": { "root": "accounts", "sides": ["leads", "customers"], "statusFile": "STATUS.md", "ballLine": "**Ball with:**" },
  "canon": { "pricing": "knowledge/pricing.md" },
  "connectors": { "markdown": {}, "status": {}, "tasks-markdown": { "file": "tasks.md" } }
}
```

`language` is the language agents write in. The code and the prompts are English.

## Connectors

A connector is one file with one contract:

```js
export default {
  name: "trello", kind: "tasks", volatile: true,
  scan(ctx, options) { /* scheduled pull → { documents?, events?, metrics?, count, added, message } */ },
  live(query, ctx, options) { /* read now → { items } */ },
  act(action, params, ctx, options) { /* one reversible write, e.g. create a card */ },
}
```

Built in: `markdown`, `status`, `metrics-http`, `stripe`, `trello`, `tasks-markdown`, `paraspeech`, `ics-calendar`, `imap`. Put a private one in `<folder>/connectors/<name>.mjs` and company-os finds it first. `act()` is for what the source itself can undo: a card, a draft, a move. Sending, paying and publishing are not actions and will not be. Secrets come from an env file the connector names, never from the folder. Details: [docs/extending.md](docs/extending.md).

## Checks

`checks/*.mjs`, plus your own in `<folder>/checks/`. Each returns findings `{ severity, where, line, what }`. company-os drops a finding on a line you already marked (`⚠️`, `SUPERSEDED`): your note wins. `silent-jobs` watches the jobs themselves, including the one that reports ok while doing nothing. That case went unnoticed here for four weeks.

## Inbox

Every finding and proposal is one markdown file in `inbox/`, fingerprinted so the same finding never lands twice. Approve and the brain applies it; reject and it stays quiet for good. The brain refuses outward actions by design.

## Jobs

```json
"jobs": [
  { "name": "index", "title": "Index the folder", "run": "company-os index", "cron": "45 7 * * 1-5" },
  { "name": "check", "title": "Weekly checks", "run": "company-os check", "cron": "0 8 * * 1" }
]
```

`company-os jobs install` renders launchd (macOS), cron or systemd timers from the same list. Every job gets a status file, a rotating log and a row in the event history. `company-os jobs run <name>` runs one now.

## MCP

`company-os serve` exposes the brain over stdio. Register it once:

```bash
claude mcp add company-os -e COMPANY_OS_ROOT=/path/to/your/folder -- company-os serve
```

Reading: `account`, `accounts`, `canon`, `search`, `mail`, `finance`, `tasks`, `calendar`, `live`, `ticket`, `status`, `check`. Writing, reversible and logged: `todo`, `task_done`, `mail_draft`. Talking back: `inbox_post`, `inbox_list`.

## Dashboard

`ui/` is a Nuxt app that shows the brain: overview, inbox, activity, status. It is a view. Buttons that start an agent should start one you can watch: our own layer hands those runs to a terminal workspace (herdr) instead of a background process, and says so when it is down. The engine itself has no such dependency — a layer chooses its own runner. It polls for changes every few seconds, so a card you create from Claude Code shows up within seconds. A private dashboard can `extends` it and add its own pages. See `ui/README.md`.

## Status

Early, and running a real company every day. The parts here survived contact with reality.
